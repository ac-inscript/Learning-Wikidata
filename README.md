## About Wikidata
Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.
It acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others.
This knowledge base also provides support to many other sites and services beyond just Wikimedia projects! The content of Wikidata is available under a free license, exported using standard formats, and can be interlinked to other open data sets on the linked data web.
So to sum up, Wikidata is: 
- a repository of the world's knowledge
- a database anyone can read and edit since it's free and multilingual

## Some statistics
Bots perform nearly half of all edits on Wikimedia projects, with a similar proportion of Wikidata's total edits made by bots and human editors. While bots handle a large volume of tasks like adding statements, labels, and descriptions, humans perform more complex and creative work. Bots are also more involved in smaller language communities where they can contribute over 50% of the edits. 
The majority of the editing concerns scholarly articles and miscellaneous topics. A great chart suming up all the topics in Wikidata can be found in https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Statistics.

## Wikidata timeline
The Wikidata project officially began on October 29, 2012, but its conception dates back to 2005. During that period, the technological landscape was rapidly evolving, and the idea of a Semantic Wikipedia was born. At Wikimania 2005 in Frankfurt, doctoral students Markus Krötzsch, Max Völkel, and Denny Vrandečić, recently involved in Semantic Web research, exchanged ideas that led to the vision of a system capable of connecting entities through typed links, specifying the nature of relationships between them. This early concept laid the groundwork for what would become Wikidata: a structured, machine-readable knowledge base linked to human-readable content on Wikipedia. Over the following years, the development of Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) and its query interfaces allowed for structured data collection and inspired external projects, despite occasional tensions with the Wikimedia Foundation. By February 2011, at a Wikimedia Data Summit in Sebastopol, Vrandečić was tasked with drafting a formal proposal, initially named data.wikimedia.org. The project received funding from the Wikimedia Foundation and other sponsors, and Wikidata was launched with a system of alphanumeric identifiers, beginning with Q1 for the universe, Q2 for Earth, Q3 for life, and so on. From 2013 to 2015, the platform expanded with community contributions, introducing properties and statements, while key tools like QuickStatements and Mix’n’Match facilitated the efficient import and linking of data, establishing Wikidata as a structured, multilingual knowledge repository.

## Some useful links
To get started in Wikidata one should browse a bit through the website and find out more about Wikidata Projects that span from Astrophisics to Politics, from Biographies to Classics and so forth, and give a first glance to the structure of the Wikidata Community, which is more and more spread every day. Some useful links to start are down below, but I'd recommend to expand the research to what might interest the reader. Some of the topics here listed are not meant to be explored as soon as the user gets started, but are either useful recomendation throughout the process of learning or Wikidata documentations on which I based this Learning Hub.
