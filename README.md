## About Wikidata
Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.
Wikidata acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others.
Wikidata also provides support to many other sites and services beyond just Wikimedia projects! The content of Wikidata is available under a free license, exported using standard formats, and can be interlinked to other open data sets on the linked data web.
So to sum up, Wikidata is: 
- a repository of the world's knowledge
- a database anyone can read and edit since it's free and multilingual

## Some statistics
Bots perform nearly half of all edits on Wikimedia projects, with a similar proportion of Wikidata's total edits made by bots and human editors. While bots handle a large volume of tasks like adding statements, labels, and descriptions, humans perform more complex and creative work. Bots are also more involved in smaller language communities where they can contribute over 50% of the edits. 
The majority of the editing concerns scholarly articles and miscellaneous topics. A great chart suming up all the topics in Wikidata can be found in
